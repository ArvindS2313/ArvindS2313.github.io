                <p class="research-body">
                    This research attempted to generate multi-instrumental music using both a combination of Transformer NNs (to provide randomness) and planning (to provide structure), with a heavy emphasis on the latter. 
                    In the first phase of the research, planning and agent-based systems were used to map out overall song and measure structures. 
                    Then, for each of the song structures, the Transformer NNs generated an initial chord sequence, which would later be tweaked by the planner. 
                    In the second phase of the research, the planner generated a melody and bass line and ensured that the chords and melody cohere. 
                    To determine whether the AI music sounded pleasant and human-like, a listening test was conducted by surveying high school and college students. 
                    Using a Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked test, it was determined that music with slightly more simplistic melody note jumps (p=0.024) and rhythms (p=0.015) were more enjoyable, while music with slightly more simplistic rhythms (p=0.0007) and chords (p=0.046) were more memorable. 
                    From feedback provided by survey respondents, we plan to make necessary changes to improve the AI in the near future.
